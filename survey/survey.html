    <!--This is where our questions begin. As you can see, the label serves as the question. Each question has a 
    unique id, and this is the element we'll retrieve in JS code. As you see, we've used a number string here.
    My thinking is that we can use coercion to make this an integer value. The "option values" are organized from "1"
    to "4". "1" is the healthiest/least pathological, "4" is the worst. There is a "<br></br> between each questions."-->
